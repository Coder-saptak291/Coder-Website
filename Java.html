            Java is a programming language and a platform. Java is a high level, robust, object-oriented and secure
            programming language.
    
            Java was developed by Sun Microsystems (which is now the subsidiary of Oracle) in the year 1995. James Gosling
            is known as the father of Java. Before Java, its name was Oak. Since Oak was already a registered company, so
            James Gosling and his team changed the name from Oak to Java.
    
    
            The history of Java is very interesting. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too
            advanced technology for the digital cable television industry at the time. The history of Java starts with the
            Green Team. Java team members (also known as Green Team), initiated this project to develop a language for
            digital devices such as set-top boxes, televisions, etc. However, it was best suited for internet programming.
            Later, Java technology was incorporated by Netscape.
