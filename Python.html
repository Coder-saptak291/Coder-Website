            Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability
            with the use of significant indentation. Its language constructs and object-oriented approach aim to help
            programmers write clear, logical code for small- and large-scale projects.Python is dynamically-typed and
            garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural),
            object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
            comprehensive standard library. Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the
            ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0. Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and
            introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and
            Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible
            with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
            Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages.
